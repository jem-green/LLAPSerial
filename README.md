Installing

* On https://github.com/jem-green/LLAPSerial at the bottom right you will find a button called "dowload zip"
* Extracting this zip will give you a folder called LLAPSerial-master 
* Rename this to LLAPSerial
* Move this to your libraries folder inside your arduino sketchbook. On windows this would be something like C:\Users\{user}\Documents\Arduino\libraries\LLAPSerial
* Restart the IDE
* Examples can then be found under File->Examples->LLAPSerial
